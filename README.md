## Scrabble Word Converter Version 1.0 07/14/2015 Ellen Lehman

##Set Up:
Clone the repository and open the program in your terminal.

##What it Does:
Scrabble Word Converter is a program that takes any word and will calculate how many points that word would receive if it were played in a game of Scrabble.  In order to run the program, enter a word in the text-field on the webpage and click submit.  The score for that word will be returned beneath the submit button. 

##Known Bugs:
The text-field will not accept punctuation but can accept capital letters.  

###This project was practice for working with BDD, JavaScript, branching, looping and collecting inputs from forms.
